# GMS Superior-class frigate "Phoenix" // 3.03.5014u

Our three Lancers, **Mark**, **Vort**, and **Uke**, make their way to the planet of **Hercynia**. During the trip they are briefed on their mission by their Commanding Officer. They are to assist **Landmark Colonial's** **Evergreen** colony in protecting itself and removing the raiders one way or another. The three also get to know each other a bit before the mission asking innocuous questions.
