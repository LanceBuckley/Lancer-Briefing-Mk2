# Mission // #004
## Rallying Cry

Dthall is brief and straightforward: she doesn’t
believe that Hivehome or Evergreen will survive
alone. In a few days, the leaders of the HUC are going to
have a meeting to decide how to proceed with the
war against the Machine. The PCs will be present for
this meeting as representatives of Evergreen.

# Goals
- Convince the city-states of the HUC to
rally under one banner, come to the aid
of Evergreen, and continue the war
against the Machine.

# Stakes
- If the HUC is not convinced to aid
Evergreen, the Hercynians won’t come to
Evergreen’s aid in MISSION 5 without
some extra effort.

# Reserves
- Establish what reserves or resources the
PCs have available prior to this mission.
This is especially important as characters
may lose access to them after
Hivehome’s destruction.
