# Mission // #005
## Split-Knuckle Haymaker

Beggar-One has overtaken Evergreen, dropped a KKR on Hivehome, and is in position to conquer Hercynia.
He must be stopped, but before going for the throat some key objectives ought to be secured.

# Goals
- Defeat Beggar-One.

# Stakes
- If this mission fails, Evergreen will remain
occupied and the extermination of the
local population will begin.

# Reserves
- The PCs can bring any reserves or gear
that they acquired during the previous
downtime. They will have multiple
opportunities to perform FULL REPAIRS
during this (final) mission, which can
potentially be very long.
